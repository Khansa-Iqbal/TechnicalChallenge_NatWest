### This is my solution to the technical challenge assigned by NatWest
## What does this repository contains?
It is a web page with a frontend coded in React library of JavaScript which fetches JSON object from a Pokemon API (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Biuni/PokemonGO-Pokedex/master/pokedex.json) and dynamically renders it as DOM elements. Following are the highlights of the concerned project:

Responsive UI built using CSS 3 (flex box)
A frontend which handles loading event of JSON object
Fetched data is alphabetically sorted
